This week has been eventful for our portfolio companies, with significant developments and challenges in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, and fintech industries. Let's start with the positive news.

HamsaPay was in the spotlight as one of the companies participating in the prestigious Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023. This event is a great opportunity for exposure and networking in the tech world. The article also mentioned the distinguished judges for the event, including individuals with experience in blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized technology.

Engiven, one of our leading complex giving providers, announced an expansion of its partnership with Pushpay, a digital giving and engagement platform. As part of this collaboration, Engiven introduced free stock donations to the Pushpay platform. This new giving option aims to make it easier and more accessible for users to donate stock directly, eliminating subscription fees.

Moving on to some challenges faced by other portfolio companies, Prime Trust encountered financial woes and was placed into receivership by a state court in Nevada. This unfortunate event had ripple effects in the market, particularly for TrueUSD (TUSD), a stablecoin. Deposits and withdrawals of TUSD were halted by Prime Trust, impacting its market share. The collapse of the acquisition deal with BitGo also affected BitGo's access to Prime Trust's payment rails. This situation highlighted the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the crypto industry in the United States, leading to ongoing investigations and actions that impact companies like Prime Trust.

Provenance Blockchain, a company that leverages blockchain technology, experienced a significant decrease in trading value for its token (HASH) against the US dollar. However, the company's technology continues to be utilized by Figure, which uses it for mortgage transactions, loan origination, servicing, financing, and private fund services. Additionally, the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the art world is recognized for addressing issues of ownership and provenance.

Our portfolio company, Figure Technologies, was mentioned in an AI news briefing alongside other companies that announced significant AI-related funding. Although the details of the funding were not provided, this recognition signifies Figure's innovative approach and its position in the competitive AI market. Moreover, Blythe Masters, an advisory board member for Figure and other notable organizations, was featured in an article discussing her net worth and past involvement with JP Morgan in commodities trading.

CoinRoutes, another company in our portfolio, made headlines in the crypto sector. CEO Dave Weisberger discussed the value gained by crypto stocks on the Robinhood platform, indicating its growing popularity among investors. CoinRoutes partnered with Crypto.com to provide smart order routing and execution services for institutional clients. Additionally, the Worldcoin token began trading on various exchanges, generating enthusiasm due to its potential to redefine digital currency. Crypto Town Hall, a platform for crypto discussions, featured well-known figures like Alex Kruger and Vinny Lingham.

RWA.xyz, a company we have invested in, announced that Avalanche Foundation committed $50 million to bring more tokenized assets to the blockchain. This move aims to leverage the faster transaction and scaling capabilities of Avalanche to compete with Ethereum. Additionally, RWA.xyz highlighted that the value of tokenized U.S. Treasuries reached an all-time high, indicating the growing demand for tokenization in the financial market.

Lastly, Centrifuge, which facilitates loans connecting traditional finance with the crypto market, achieved a milestone with 14.44 million DAI tokens lent through the Spark Protocol. However, lending to a tokenized credit pool on Centrifuge was suspended by a unanimous community vote, underscoring the importance of community governance in decentralized finance.

In summary, this week brought both positive and challenging developments for our portfolio companies. While HamsaPay received recognition at a prestigious event, Engiven expanded its partnership to offer new giving options. On the other hand, Prime Trust faced financial difficulties, Provenance Blockchain experienced a decrease in token value, and Centrifuge witnessed a temporary suspension of lending. Meanwhile, Figure Technologies and CoinRoutes continued to make progress in their respective markets. Overall, the crypto, blockchain, and fintech industries are evolving rapidly, presenting both opportunities and obstacles for our portfolio companies.
