  const reports = ["REPORT FOR COMPANIES IN ['Invested'] \nIn this week's investor report, we have a mix of news from our portfolio companies. Let's start with Prime Trust, a crypto custodian that has been ordered by the District Court of Nevada to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. The company is facing financial difficulties, with liabilities of $85.67 million in fiat currency. This situation has affected TrueUSD, a stablecoin, as it has lost $82 million in client funds. The custodial choices of TrueUSD, including Prime Trust, are being questioned, raising concerns about the stability of stablecoins. The investor community is closely monitoring the developments surrounding Prime Trust's financial difficulties, as the company's assets, including cryptocurrency, have been impounded by the National Financial Institutions Division (NFID). Despite the market turmoil caused by the situation with Prime Trust and other factors, some stablecoin holders have chosen to stay put.\n\nMoving on to Figure Technologies, one of our portfolio companies, we have learned that they have laid off 90 employees, approximately 20% of their workforce. This layoff comes as Figure Technologies prepares for an initial public offering (IPO), and they are seeking fresh funds to navigate the tough market conditions. It is worth noting that Figure Technologies is co-founded by Mike Cagney, the former CEO of Social Finance Inc. (SoFi). Despite these challenges, Figure Technologies remains a key player in our portfolio and continues to explore opportunities in the market.\n\nDecent DAO's portfolio company, Shen Xiaoshan, has been saving money for several years to purchase a decent dao weapon. The dao material for the weapon has been priced at 15 Dao Emissary. While this news may not directly impact our investments, it's interesting to see the passion and commitment of individuals in the DAO ecosystem.\n\nNext, we have Engiven, which has expanded its partnership with Pushpay, a leading complex giving provider in the U.S. This partnership now includes free stock donations as part of Engiven's platform, significantly increasing the donation options available to users. CEO James Lawrence of Engiven highlighted the significant volume of stock donations, amounting to tens of billions of dollars, that are made each year. This new partnership is expected to further facilitate and enhance stock donations for Engiven's user base. It's worth noting that Engiven is already invested in by Pushpay, indicating a pre-existing relationship between the two organizations.\n\nProvenance Blockchain, a portfolio company, has reported a self-reported market capitalization of $2.72 billion, with its token, HASH, reaching a price of $0.0222 on exchanges. The trading volume for Provenance Blockchain reached $219.42 in a 24-hour period. However, Provenance Blockchain traded 36.2% lower against the US dollar over the past week. It's also worth mentioning that Figure Technologies, the parent company of Provenance Blockchain, is considering spinning off some of its businesses. As we continue to monitor these developments, it's important to assess the performance of Provenance Blockchain and its potential impact on our portfolio.\n\nLastly, RWA.xyz, a real-world asset data platform, has seen several key events this week. The Avalanche Foundation has pledged $50 million towards bringing more tokenized assets to the blockchain, which aligns with the goals of RWA.xyz. Additionally, RWA.xyz mentions that the value of tokenized U.S. Treasuries has reached an all-time high of $641 million, with tokenization growing by over 460% since the beginning of the year. Avalanche's $50 million investment in RWA.xyz showcases the recognition of its capabilities in terms of faster transactions and scaling capabilities. It is worth noting that all the events and articles mentioned in this report are related to RWA.xyz, as the company is invested in and has a linked company, recZ63PeTWleoTEds.\n\nIn conclusion, we have witnessed a mix of challenges and opportunities for our portfolio companies this week. As Prime Trust faces financial difficulties and TrueUSD grapples with the implications, we are closely monitoring the situation. Figure Technologies is preparing for an IPO amidst layoffs, while Decent DAO and Engiven continue to explore opportunities and expand their partnerships. Provenance Blockchain is reporting market turbulence, and RWA.xyz is benefiting from significant investments and growth in tokenized assets. We will continue to assess these developments and navigate the ever-changing landscape of the market.\n \n EVENT SUMMARIES: \nPrime Trust:\n- Prime Trust, a crypto custodian, has been ordered by the District Court of Nevada to initiate bankruptcy proceedings.

Let's start with Centrifuge. MakerDAO, a decentralized lending platform, recently voted to suspend lending to a tokenized credit pool on the Centrifuge protocol. This credit pool was managed by fintech firm Harbor Trade. Despite the successful launch of the Spark Protocol, the community decided to suspend lending to the pool. In terms of trading activity, Centrifuge saw a 24-hour trading volume of $205,592.22 and a 1-day volume of $367,172.34. Additionally, Centrifuge reported a self-reported market cap of $16.88 million. However, it is worth noting that the token price for Centrifuge (cfg) has declined by 10.6% this week.\n\nMoving on to OpenEden, they have announced a partnership with a \"superapp\" to bring a smart contract vault that provides 24/7 access to tokenized US Treasury bills in emerging markets. This vault will allow investors to securely access and trade these tokenized assets. OpenEden is an accredited and licensed institution by the Monetary Authority, adding to their credibility and trustworthiness in the market.\n\nNext, let's discuss Credix. They have opened a private credit pool on the Solana blockchain, offering lenders an annual yield of nearly 11%. This private credit pool is backed by trade receivables collateral and settled through the Credix platform using USDC stablecoin. What makes this innovation unique is that it is fully insured by CESCE Colombia, a subsidiary of the Spanish Export Credit Agency. Credix collaborated with several industry partners, including Clave, Solana Foundation, Keyrock Trading, and Circle, to launch this pioneering USDC receivables pool. The Solana Foundation, a significant player in the crypto space, has also invested in Credix's decentralized finance (DeFi) credit marketplace on Solana.\n\nLastly, I want to mention a development that may have broader implications for the industry. The UK's top crime agency has assembled a team of crypto investigators, which could potentially impact Credix's operations in the future. It is an important development to monitor, as regulatory changes and increased scrutiny in the crypto space may have an impact on our investments.\n\nOn a separate note, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, has been fined $14 million for privacy issues related to Onavo. While this news does not directly impact Credix, it is important to be aware of industry developments and their potential implications.\n\nOverall, we have seen both positive and challenging developments within our portfolio companies this week. We will continue to monitor the market trends and industry dynamics to ensure our investments remain well-positioned and aligned with our investors' interests.\n \n EVENT SUMMARIES: \nCentrifuge:\n- MakerDAO faced a unanimous community vote to suspend lending to a tokenized credit pool on the Centrifuge protocol, managed by fintech firm Harbor Trade, despite the recent success of Spark Protocol.\n- Centrifuge's 24-hour trading volume reached $205,592.22, while its 1-day volume hit $367,172.34.\n- Centrifuge's self-reported market cap reached $16.88 million.\n- Centrifuge's token (cfg) has been trading down 10.6% this week.\n\nOpenEden:\n- OpenEden has partnered with a proclaimed \"superapp\" to bring a smart contract vault that provides 24/7 access to tokenized US Treasury bills in emerging markets.\n- OpenEden is an accredited and licensed institution by the Monetary Authority.\n\nCredix:\n- Credix has opened a private credit pool on the Solana blockchain, offering lenders an annual yield of nearly 11%.\n- The private credit pool is backed by trade receivables collateral and settled through the Credix platform using USDC stablecoin.
